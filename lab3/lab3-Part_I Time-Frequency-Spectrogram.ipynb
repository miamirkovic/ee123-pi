As is the convention with the DFT, zero frequency is the first sample, and the Nyquist rate corresponds to the middle sample. The sampling rate in this example was 8192Hz, so the maximum frequency is 4096Hz. Note that the frequency has dropped about 300 Hz between the first and second block."

Instead, the most common presentation is to display the information in an image format, with frequency on the vertical axis, time on the horizontal axis, and the value of a particular pixel being the magnitude of the spectra at that time and frequency.

    "So far we've just set the block size to 256 samples, which is about 5.8 ms of data.  The frequency resolution is then 44100/256 = 172.27 Hz.  Ideally we'd like to have both time and frequency resolution. However, one comes at the expense of the other.  For example if we wanted to improve our frequency resolution to 86.13 Hz, it would increase the time between samples to 11.6 ms.\n",
    "\n",
    "The optimum tradeoff between the two factors depends on the nature of the spectrum you are analyzing.  A good example is the orca whale call, signal s3.  This has segments that are very rapidly changing, and segments where the changes are slow.  Try different block sizes, from 128, 256, 512, and 1024 samples.  Note how the frequency resolution improves, while the temporal resolution degrades."
